Men strong enough to toss lesser men across the battlefield tried, but few were strong enough to last even a day with the banner in-hand. The last captain to attempt the test, a young man named Khan, held the banner in his hands for hours. As his arms tired, he beckoned to a common servant and tasked her with taking the banner from him and keeping it upright. “Even though I must fall,” he said, “the banner will remain.” Thus he passed the test, for this was no test of strength, but one of loyalty to House Aico. Khan proved himself worthy of command with his actions that day. Now, he serves Lian as advisor and protector, a steadfast supporter of House Aico.",
